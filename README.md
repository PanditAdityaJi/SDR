# SDR

## Introduction

Software-Defined Radio is a paradigm where radio communication system components that have typically been implemented in hardware (e.g., mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.

## Objectives

- Develop a modular and flexible SDR implementation.
- Replace traditional hardware with software solutions for radio processing.
- Provide a base for further research and development in the field of SDR.

## Future Work

- Implement signal processing modules.
- Add support for various modulation schemes.
- Integrate with external hardware for real-time signal analysis.
